            <h2>Q-1. Whats the difference between local storage and session storag?</h2>
            <h3>Local Storage</strong>: This read-only interface property provides access to the Document’s local storage object, the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that localStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends – that is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the last “private” tab of a browser is closed (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private browsing or incognito session).</h3>
            <h3><strong>Session Storage</strong>:  Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.</h3>

            <h2>Q-2. Whats the difference between Global Scope and Block Scope?</h2>

A code block simply consists of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). if statement, loops, function are examples of structure that create a code block. A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code.</h3>
            <h3><strong>Block Scope</strong>:  Block scope contains things defined inside code blocks. A local variable has local scope. A local variable is only accessible where it’s declared.</h3>
